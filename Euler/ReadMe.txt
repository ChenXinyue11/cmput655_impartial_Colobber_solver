We have implemented the algorithms from Nimbers Are Inevitable (NimberXXX.py), On pruning search trees of impartial games (cutXXX.py, is_losing_ETC.py).

The fastest algorithm (Nimber_endgame.py) for 1d Clobber so far is from Nimbers Are Inevitable with rearranged moves, endgame database and transposition table.

The algorithms' performances (NimberAlgorithmsOrdering2d.py) for 2d Clobber haven't been tested yet (will be included in the final report).

The test results (test_result_1d.txt, test_result_2d.txt,) for the currently best algorithms are included. More detailed tests will be covered in the final report. 
Test scripts for 1d: Nimber_endgame.py; for 2d: test2d.py

Every Algorithm can be run with the main functions with test cases.
Test_result_rough contains unsorted results.
